## Context

I embarked on this project for personal reasons. 
Motivated to travel through Spain by car, I developed an algorithm to calculate the optimal route among various possibilities.

Using a brute-force approach was impractical due to high computational costs. 
As a result, I created my first linear programming algorithm to efficiently solve the problem.

I am ready to go! ðŸš™ðŸ§³
